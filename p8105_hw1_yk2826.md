Problem 1
=========

This problem focuses on variable types and coercion.
----------------------------------------------------

First I create a data frame comprised of:

A random sample of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution

A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2

A (length-10) character vector

A (length-10) factor vector

``` r
coercion_df = tibble(
  vec_unif = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5),
  vec_logical = vec_unif > 2,
  vec_char = c("My", "name", "is", "Yueming", "Kou", "and", "I", "love", "Data", 
               "Science"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("white", "black", "red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", 
                        "purple", "grey", "pink"))
)
```

The chunk below try to take the mean of each variable in coercion\_df

``` r
mean(coercion_df$vec_unif)
```

    ## [1] 2.781371

``` r
mean(coercion_df$vec_logical)
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean(coercion_df$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(coercion_df$vec_char): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(coercion_df$vec_factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(coercion_df$vec_factor): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The "mean()" function works for the random sample and the logical vector, but it doesn't work for the character vector and the factor vector. The reason is elements of the character vector and the factor vector are not numeric or logical.
