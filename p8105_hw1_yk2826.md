Problem 1
=========

This problem focuses on variable types and coercion.
----------------------------------------------------

First I create a data frame comprised of:

A random sample of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution

A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2

A (length-10) character vector

A (length-10) factor vector

``` r
coercion_df = tibble(
  vec_unif = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5),
  vec_logical = vec_unif > 2,
  vec_char = c("My", "name", "is", "Yueming", "Kou", "and", "I", "love", "Data", 
               "Science"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("white", "black", "red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", 
                        "purple", "grey", "pink"))
)
```
